mlchk v1.0.0 by Bystroushaak (bystrousak@kitakitsune.org)

This program is used for emulating mechanical logic. I don't really expect that
this could be usefull for anyone except me, but hope dies last..

Program accepts pairs of information - part "type : instance name", 
"name - other name". This is pretty lame, so maybe one day I will write  more
usefull parser. 

Possible parts are:
    gear : <instance name>
    igear : <instance name> [<parameters (L for left, R for right, N for None)>]
    rdiode : <instance name> # every diode has .in and .out property!
    ldiode : <instance name>

Script example:

    # lines starting with '#' are ignored
    igear : in L R N
    rdiode : rd
    gear : g

    in - rd.in
    rd.out - g

Output is in dsv - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values :

    in, rd.in, rd.out, g, 
    Left, Right, Right, Left, 
    Right, Left, None, None, 
    None, None, None, None,
